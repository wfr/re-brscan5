### Legal questions
I believe this project is fully legal under EU and German law. Its sole purpose
is to achieve interoperability of an independently created program with other
programs.

#### EU Software Directive 2009/24/EC

Article 6

Decompilation

1.   The authorisation of the rightholder shall not be required where
     reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the meaning of
     points (a) and (b) of Article 4(1) are indispensable to obtain the
     information necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently
     created computer program with other programs, provided that the following
     conditions are met:

(a) those acts are performed by the licensee or by another person having a
    right to use a copy of a program, or on their behalf by a person authorised to
    do so;

(b) the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously
    been readily available to the persons referred to in point (a); and

(c) those acts are confined to the parts of the original program which are
    necessary in order to achieve interoperability.

2.   The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not permit the information obtained
     through its application:

(a) to be used for goals other than to achieve the interoperability of the
    independently created computer program;

(b) to be given to others, except when necessary for the interoperability of
    the independently created computer program; or

(c) to be used for the development, production or marketing of a computer
    program substantially similar in its expression, or for any other act which
    infringes copyright.

3.   In accordance with the provisions of the Berne Convention for the
     protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the provisions of this Article
     may not be interpreted in such a way as to allow its application to be
     used in a manner which unreasonably prejudices the rightholder's
     legitimate interests or conflicts with a normal exploitation of the
     computer program.
